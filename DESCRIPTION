Description: ready4show provides tools for authoring repeatable analyses
    and to help automate the generation of scientific summaries for
    modelling studies implemented with the ready4 framework.  For detailed
    documentation about the framework and how to use it visit
    <https://www.ready4-dev.com/>. For a background to the methodological
    issues that the framework is attempting to help solve, see Hamilton et
    al. (2024) <doi:10.1007/s40273-024-01378-8>.  This development version
    of the ready4show package has been made available as part of the
    process of testing and documenting the package. If you have any
    questions, please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).

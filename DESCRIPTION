Description: ready4show provides a set of classes and
    methods for authoring reports and user-interfaces that showcase
    insights generated by projects developped with the ready4 suite of
    tools for mental health data synthesis and modelling.  This
    development version of the ready4show package has been made available
    as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The
    tools contained in this development release automate a number of tasks
    which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore
    you should only trial this software if you feel confident that you
    understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
    can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).

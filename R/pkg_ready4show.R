#' ready4show: Standardised Developer Tools for Sharing Insights from Projects
#' Developed with the Ready4 Suite
#'
#' ready4show provides a set of classes and methods for
#' authoring reports and user-interfaces that showcase insights generated
#' by projects developped with the ready4 suite of tools for mental
#' health data synthesis and modelling.  This development version of the
#' ready4show package has been made available as part of the process of
#' testing and documenting the package. The tools contained in this
#' development release automate a number of tasks which MODIFY THE
#' DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore you should only
#' trial this software if you feel confident that you understand what it
#' does and have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake
#' testing. If you have any questions, please contact the authors
#' (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
